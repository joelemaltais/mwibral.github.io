I am a physicist working on solving neuroscience puzzles using information theoretic methods. I am one of the architects of the IDTxl toolbox, mostly contributing algorithms and estimators.

### More Information

I work at the Campus Institute for Dynamics of Biological Networks at the Georg August University in Göttingen, the latter being the scientific home of Gauss, Noether, Hilbert, Klein, Minkowski and many others.
